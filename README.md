# Minimalist Resume Builder

A modern, responsive web application for building clean, professional résumés. Live preview and one-click export mean you see exactly what recruiters will get—no surprises, no formatting fights.

The tech world thrives on open source, and this project pays it forward: a React + TypeScript codebase spun up with Vite for lightning-fast builds and rock-solid type safety.

For years, the default tools have been Microsoft Word or Google Docs. They work, but they’re cluttered: endless menus, hidden settings, and a decade-old template gallery that still thinks “Times New Roman” is a personality. LaTeX and Overleaf solve the aesthetics problem, yet they demand a foreign markup language most job-seekers have never met.

This app bridges the gap: the polish of LaTeX, the ease of a modern form. No installs, no syntax, no Ctrl+Alt+‽ just to left-align a heading. Write once, export forever.
